Description: The user can specify an ordering over the variables to their prior ranking of the variables' importances. Models are fitting over a sequence of subsets of exponentially decreasing size, with variables removed respecting the ordering. If none is supplied, the ordering is implied by the sample columns of the design matrix. Cross-validation routines are also included.
